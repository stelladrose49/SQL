#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How  many ordes were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT sum(quantity)*price AS revenue, product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
